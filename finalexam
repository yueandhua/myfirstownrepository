### Abstract:  The article discusses four kinds of idealized models to find the differences between the different ways to calculate the relationship between simple pendulum amplitude and time. Then, I will increase the complexity of the model by means of increasing the damping coefficient,increasing the pressure and adding non-linear solution. I will choose one of these ways to have a discussion of simple pendulum movement.
